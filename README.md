# Machine-Learning-Projects
The projects that I've displayed here are the result of a currently a few months of independent learning on ML/AI processes. To do this I have learnt from a few books, one which I have found immensely helpful is "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, and also the specialization course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

I am still currently in the process of learning different topics in ML engineering, so this page will be updated every now and again, once I have created a noteook which I am proud enough to display to the world.

The next step in my learning will be using Recurrent NN's in NLP problems, I plan on creating a model which is capable of performing sentiment analysis on a large piece of text, and also a model which is capable of generating "fake" Shakespearean text.
