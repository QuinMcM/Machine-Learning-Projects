The aim of this project is to use the Fashion MNIST dataset (which is essentially a slightly more complicated version of the classic MNIST set and achieve an accuracy score of at least 95% on this using different methods.

We will first try an approach using a Dense Neural Network, and attempt to increase the accuracy on this by altering some of the hyperparameters available to us, and once we are happy that our results are as good as they can get we will then try a Convolutional Neural Network, which is more adept at learning from images.

Please note that this project is still in progress as we have yet to achieve an accuracy score of over 95%.
